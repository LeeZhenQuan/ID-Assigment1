# ID-Assigment1 - Creating an Resume Websites

This project is designing and building an HTML website from the scratch utilizing the skills we've learned in school. The webpage I'm building is for my own personal resume, which I'll share with prospective employers.
Adobe Wireframe and Visual Studio Code are two of the programs I utilize.
Before I begin creating a website, I must first plan out how the design and layout of the website should be, and I have used Adobe Wireframe to assist me in completing this design and layout. Then, in Visual Studio Code, type out my html code.


# Design Process

For my Wireframe design, I choose to make it simple so that other people that browse this site may find it easily. This website was created primarily to display my resume to potential employers. Employers can view extra details on these websites that aren't easily available on LinkedIn or in a traditional hardcopy resume form.

In this Project I have inculde "CSS" folder , "Image" folder, "Javascript" folder and "Wireframe" folder.

You can locate and view my wireframe design in the "Wireframe" folder, which has all of the designs for how I wanted my webpages to be laid up.

My stylesheet may be found in the "CSS" folder, which aids in the design of websites which include normalize.css that help to set everything to default follow by using styles.css to utilizing my own styles that I wanted.

In the "Image" folder which inculde an personal image of myself and image of LinkedIn Icon.

Finally, under the "Javascript" folder is the Javascript code that I created and that will only execute in the contact.html email me button.

# Features
On the top of every html page, there will be a navigation bar.

A brief introduction of me can be found in index.html.
My professional experiences, education, and skills are all listed in resume.html.

There is a pptx slide inside project.html that will show one of my project work during my ITE days. Because the powerpoint slide is linked to the organization's email as part of their security policy, you must be a member of the organization to access it.

The picture button on the inside of contact.html will take you to my LinkedIn profile page, while the other button labeled Email me will display a text directly below the button after the user clicks it. The display text is created with javascript.
